When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If it's something I expect others to be working on, I'd better not store
    code in a local repo. For example, if I am making a proprietary software
    with a team, it needs to be accessable and editable by everyone. Or,
    if it's an open source project, I expect collaborators to get their
    hands dirty as well.
    
    Even if I don't expect others to use it, I might as well make a
    GitHub repo since it is cloud connected. I can access it easily
    everwhere I go, and I don't need to rely on my whimpy little hard
    drive.
    
    Note to self: Can't I just store my local repo in Dropbox to
    circumvent this?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Simple reason...
    I have no idea what changes were made.

    What if the changes is in the file I am currently working on?
    Better yet, what if the LINE I am on right now was changed by someone
    else?
    What happens when I find that in the next second, all my hard work
    is gone, automatically?

    You don't want me angry.

    The solution is to let me decide when I've made a logical, local change.
    Then, I can pull the repo to find what else has changed.
    If there's a conflict, Git will let me know, and I can trash-talk the other
    collaborators and have my way.
