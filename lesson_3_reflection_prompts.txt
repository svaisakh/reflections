When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If it's something I expect others to be working on, I'd better not store
    code in a local repo. For example, if I am making a proprietary software
    with a team, it needs to be accessable and editable by everyone. Or,
    if it's an open source project, I expect collaborators to get their
    hands dirty as well.
    
    Even if I don't expect others to use it, I might as well make a
    GitHub repo since it is cloud connected. I can access it easily
    everwhere I go, and I don't need to rely on my whimpy little hard
    drive.
    
    Note to self: Can't I just store my local repo in Dropbox to
    circumvent this?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
